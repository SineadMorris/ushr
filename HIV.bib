abstract = {In this article we study the relationship between virologic and immunologic responses in AIDS clinical trials. Since plasma HIV RNA copies (viral load) and CD4+ cell counts are crucial virologic and immunologic markers for HIV infection, it is important to study their relationship during HIV/AIDS treatment. We propose a mixed-effects varying-coefficient model based on an exploratory analysis of data from a clinical trial. Since both viral load and CD4+ cell counts are subject to measurement error, we also consider the measurement error problem in covariates in our model. The regression spline method is proposed for inference for parameters in the proposed model. The regression spline method transforms the unknown nonparametric components into parametric functions. It is relatively simple to implement using readily available software, and parameter inference can be developed from standard parametric models. We apply the proposed models and methods to an AIDS clinical study. From this study, we find an interesting relationship between viral load and CD4+ cell counts during antiviral treatments. Biological interpretations and clinical implications are discussed.},

Recovery of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses occurred after 12 weeks for Candida and after 48 weeks for mumps. The magnitude of virologic suppression was correlated with numeric increases in CD4+ T cells, but not with measures of functional immune reconstitution. Plasma virus suppression {\textless}100 copies/mL was not significantly correlated with increases in CD4+ T cells or functional immune reconstitution.},

Although highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens can increase circulating CD4 T lymphocyte counts and decrease the risk of opportunistic complications, the effects of these treatments on immune reconstitution are not well understood. In 44 persons with moderately advanced HIV-1 infection, after 12 weeks of treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine, and ritonavir, plasma HIV-1 RNA fell a median of 2.3 logs (P {\textless} .0001). Circulating numbers of naive and memory CD4 T lymphocytes (P {\textless} .001), naive CD8 T lymphocytes (P {\textless} .004), and B lymphocytes (P {\textless} .001) increased. Improved lymphocyte proliferation to certain antigens and a tendency to improvement in delayed-type hypersensitivity also were seen. Dysregulated immune activation was partially corrected by this regimen; however, the perturbed expression of T cell receptor V regions in the CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte populations was not significantly affected.

abstract = {Investigation of HIV viral dynamics is important for understanding the HIV pathogenesis and for development of treatment strategies. Perelson et al. demonstrated that simple viral dynamic models fit to data on viral load as measured by plasma HIV-RNA could produce estimates of rates of clearance of virus and of infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. In this paper we extend the work of Perelson et al. by proposing models with less restrictive assumptions about drug activity. Our models take into account the fact that infectious and non-infectious virions are produced by infected T-cells both before and after the treatment. We also show that direct measurement of infectious virus load provides sufficient information for estimation of antiretroviral drug efficacy parameter. For characterizing viral dynamics of populations and estimation of dynamic parameters, we propose a hierarchical non-linear model. Compared to other methods such as the non-linear least square method used by Perelson et al., we show that the proposed approach has the following advantages: (i) it is more appropriate for modelling within-patient and between-patient variation and to characterize the population dynamics; (ii) it is flexible enough to deal with both rich and sparse individual data; (iii) it has more power to detect model misspecification; (iv) it allows incorporation of covariates for viral dynamic parameters; (v) it makes more efficient use of between-subject information to get better parameter estimates. We give two simulation examples to illustrate the proposed approach and its advantages. Finally, we discuss practical issues regarding the clinical trial design for viral dynamic studies.},

abstract = {Cell-mediated immunity and T-lymphocyte maturation are impaired in HIV-infected children. These abnormalities would be detected in HIV-uninfected offspring of HIV women (seroreverters [SR]) if HIV or its soluble proteins could cross the placental barrier. Immunophenotypic analyses were performed in 20 healthy HIV-uninfected newborns of HIV-infected mothers (SR), and in 14 healthy newborns of HIV-negative women (UC). The same analyses were performed in 3 groups of older children: SR (n = 41); UC (n = 15); and HIV-infected children (n = 25). Antigen-specific cells were evaluated with ELISpot and fluorimetric analyses; IL-7 serum concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that in SR newborns: (1) the CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced, (2) CD4(+) and CD8(+) naive T-cell percentages were decreased, (3) percentage of activated CD8(+) T cells was increased, and (4) percentages of CD3(+)/4(-)/8(-) (DN) and DN/25(-)/44(+) were augmented. These abnormalities were partially retained in older SR children. CD4(+) and CD8(+) HIV-specific cells were detected in a portion of newborn SRs but not in older SRs. Serum IL-7 was augmented both in newborn and older SRs. Cell-mediated immunity and T-cell maturation are altered even in HIV-uninfected newborns of HIV-infected mothers; these abnormalities persist over time. The biologic significance of these observations and potential subsequent clinical events should be investigated in larger cohorts of seroreverters. (Blood. 2000;96:3866-3871)},

abstract = {Background Interim results from the children with HIV early antiretroviral (CHER) trial showed that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) was life-saving for infants infected with HIV. In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART, in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART. Methods CHER was an open-label randomised controlled trial of HIV-infected asymptomatic infants younger than 12 weeks in two South African trial sites with a percentage of CD4-positive T lymphocytes (CD4{\%}) of 25{\%} or higher. 377 infants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: deferred ART (ART-Def), immediate ART for 40 weeks (ART-40W), or immediate ART for 96 weeks (ART-96W), with subsequent treatment interruption. The randomisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of random sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group. Criteria for ART initiation in the ART-Def group and re-initiation after interruption in the other groups were CD4{\%} less than 25{\%} in infancy; otherwise, the criteria were CD4{\%} less than 20{\%} or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe stage B or stage C disease. Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation. The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART (immunological, clinical, or virological) or death. Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis, with use of time-to-event methods. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00102960. Findings 377 infants were enrolled, with a median age of 7{\textperiodcentered}4 weeks, CD4{\%} of 35{\%}, and HIV RNA log 5{\textperiodcentered}7 copies per mL. Median follow-up was 4{\textperiodcentered}8 years; 34 infants (9{\%}) were lost to follow-up. Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks (IQR 16-25). Time to restarting of ART after interruption was 33 weeks (26-45) in ART-40W and 70 weeks (35-109) in ART-96W; at the end of the trial, 19{\%} of patients in ART-40W and 32{\%} of patients in ART-96W remained off ART. Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81{\%} in the ART-Def group, 70{\%} in the ART-40W group, and 69{\%} in the ART-96W group. 48 (38{\%}) of 125 children in the ART-Def group, 32 (25{\%}) of 126 in the ART-40W group, and 26 (21{\%}) of 126 in the ART-96W group reached the primary endpoint. The hazard ratio, relative to ART-Def, was 0{\textperiodcentered}59 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38-0{\textperiodcentered}93, p=0{\textperiodcentered}02) for ART-40W and 0{\textperiodcentered}47 (0{\textperiodcentered}27-0{\textperiodcentered}76, p=0{\textperiodcentered}002) for ART-96W. Three children in ART-Def, three in ART-40W, and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART. Interpretation Early time-limited ART had better clinical and immunological outcomes than deferred ART, with no evidence of excess disease progression during subsequent treatment interruption and less overall ART exposure than deferred ART. Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption, with marginally better outcomes. Funding US National Institutes of Health.},

abstract = {Understanding how our T-cell compartments are maintained re-quires knowledge of their population dynamics, which are typically quantified over days to weeks using the administration of labels incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. These studies present snapshots of homeostatic dynamics and have suggested that lymphocyte populations are heterogeneous with respect to rates of division and/or death, although resolving the details of such heterogeneity is problematic. Here we present a method of study-ing the population dynamics of T cells in mice over timescales of months to years that reveals heterogeneity in rates of division and death with respect to the age of the host at the time of thymic export. We use the transplant conditioning drug busulfan to ablate hematopoetic stem cells in young mice but leave the peripheral lymphocyte compartments intact. Following their reconstitution with congenically labeled (donor) bone marrow, we followed the dilution of peripheral host T cells by donor-derived lymphocytes for a year after treatment. Describing these kinetics with mathemat-ical models, we estimate rates of thymic production, division and death of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells. Population-averaged estimates of mean lifetimes are consistent with earlier studies, but we find the strongest support for a model in which both naive T-cell pools con-tain kinetically distinct subpopulations of older host-derived cells with self-renewing capacity that are resistant to displacement by naive donor lymphocytes. We speculate that these incumbent cells are conditioned or selected for increased fitness through homeo-static expansion into the lymphopenic neonatal environment. T-cell homeostasis | mathematical modeling | Ki67 | kinetic heterogeneity N ormal adaptive immunity depends on maintaining pop-ulations of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells of sufficient sizes and diversities of antigen receptors. Mature naive cells are generated by the thymus and, once in the periphery, divide slowly and are lost either to death or differentiation into effector cells. It is known qualitatively how both cytokine (1–7) and T-cell receptor (TCR) (4, 8, 9) signals influence their survival and self-renewal through division, but we still lack a quantitative understanding of the rules that govern the development and persistence of our naive T-cell repertoires. To develop our understanding of lymphocyte homeostasis, much effort has been directed at defining the kinetics of T cells under normal physiological conditions. Division and death are normally quantified by following the accumulation and loss of cells labeled in vivo with BrdU or deuterium from heavy water or deuterated glucose, taken up by dividing cells during adminis-tration of label and diluted following its withdrawal (10–20). These experiments are typically performed over days to weeks and collectively have revealed that cell populations initially assumed to be homogenous may in fact comprise multiple subpopulations dividing and dying at different rates (kinetic heterogeneity) and/or that cells that are quiescent or have recently divided may have different susceptibilities to death (temporal heterogeneity). Dis-criminating between these scenarios with labeling alone is difficult (16), and the parameter estimates inferred from in vivo labeling are also sensitive to the assumed nature of heterogeneity (15, 16, 20), the duration of labeling (14, 20), and assumptions regarding the relative contributions of input of cells from external sources and self-renewal through division (11, 21). With the exception of a study that distinguished recent thymic emigrants and mature naive cells (22), heterogeneity has also been left as a rather general concept in labeling studies and not tied firmly to any other variables or identifiable subsets of cells. Average T-cell lifetimes in both mice and humans appear to vary with age (18), and so it seems plausible that turnover may be heterogeneous with respect to cell age, measured by the time since export from the thymus. However, without stratifying cells by their residence histories, labeling provides only host age-specific, cross-sectional snapshots of population dynamics. Thus, we need more information to build a unified description of T-cell homeostasis from birth into old age that will allow us to explain how the phenotypic composition and TCR repertoires of lym-phocyte compartments evolve over an individual's lifetime. In this study, we quantify the homeostatic dynamics and probe the age structure of the naive CD4 and CD8 T-cell compartments over a year of a mouse's life, using what we term a " temporal fate mapping " approach. Hematopoetic stem cells of young adult mice were specifically replaced with congenically labeled stem cells while leaving the peripheral T-cell compartment intact. We monitored the replacement of host T cells with de novo-generated donor T cells. Although a simple model of homogeneous dynamics is able to describe the total naive CD4 and CD8 compartment sizes over the course of a year, this model and even extremely general ex-tensions of it were unable to simultaneously explain the changes in},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We analyzed the early kinetics with integrase inhibitor treatment to gain new insights into viral dynamics. METHODOLOGY We analyzed data from 39 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive, participants: 28 treated with raltegravir (RAL; multiple doses) monotherapy for 9 days, and 11 with RAL 400 mg twice daily and emtricitabine (200 mg daily)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg daily). Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured frequently; the data was fitted using a mathematical model of viral dynamics distinguishing between infected cells with unintegrated HIV DNA and productively infected cells. Parameters were estimated using mixed-effect models. RESULTS RAL treatment led to a biphasic viral decline with a rapid first phase (1a) lasting approximately 5 days followed by a slower phase (1b). Phase 1a is attributed to the rapid elimination of productively infected cells. Phase 1b reflects the loss of infected cells with nonintegrated provirus due to cell loss and integration of HIV DNA. The half-lives of productively infected cells and of infected cells that had completed reverse transcription but had not yet integrated HIV DNA were approximately 19 h and between 3.6 and 5.8 days, respectively. The effectiveness of RAL in preventing proviral integration was 94{\%} and 99.7{\%}, for the combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively. CONCLUSION We found that the first phase of viral decay with RAL therapy was composed of two subphases corresponding to the half-lives of infected cells with integrated proviruses and with unintegrated HIV-DNA.},

abstract = {Patients infected with HIV exhibit orders of magnitude differences in their set-point levels of the plasma viral load. As to what extent this variation is due to differences in the efficacy of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in these patients is unclear. Several studies have shown that HIV-infected CD4+ T cells also present viral epitopes that are recognized by CTLs before the productive stage of infection, i.e., during the intracellular eclipse phase before the infected cell starts to produce new viral particles. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the potential impact of early killing of HIV-infected cells on viral replication. We suggest that the majority of CTL-mediated killing could occur during the viral eclipse phase, and that the killing of virus-producing cells could be substantially lower at later stages due to MHC-I-down-regulation. Such a mechanism is in agreement with several experimental observations that include CD8+ T cell depletion and antiretroviral drug treatment. This indicates a potentially important role of CTL-mediated killing during the non-productive stage of HIV-infected cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serologic tests for HIV infection in infants less than 18 months do not differentiate exposure and infection since maternally acquired IgG antibodies may be detected in infants. Thus, the gold standard for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants under the age of 2 years is DNA or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. There is an urgent need to evaluate alternative and cost effective laboratory methods for early diagnosis of infant HIV-1 infection as well as identifying infected infants who may benefit from cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and/or initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: Whole blood was collected in EDTA from 137 infants aged 0 to 18 months. DNA polymerase chain reaction was used as the reference standard for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. T-cell subset profiles were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Seventy-six infants were DNA PCR positive while 61 were negative. The median CD4 counts of PCR negative infants were significantly higher than those of the PCR positive infants, p {\textless} 0.001. The median CD4/CD8 ratio and the {\%}CD4 of the PCR positive infants were both significantly lower than those of the negative infants, p {\textless} 0.001. The CD4/CD8 ratio had a {\textgreater}98{\%} sensitivity for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and a specificity of {\textgreater}98{\%}. CONCLUSION: The CD4/CD8 ratio appears useful in identifying HIV-infected infants.

abstract = {Latent infection of resting CD4 + T cells represents a major barrier to eradication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The establishment and rate of decay of latent HIV-1 in resting CD + T cells from 9 acute seroconverters, 7 of whom began to receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) shortly after presentation, were studied. Before the initiation of therapy, these patients had very high frequencies of latently infected CD4 + T cells, with a median frequency of 205 infectious units per million resting CD4 + T cells. These values are 1 log higher than those seen in chronically infected patients who are not undergoing HAART. The number of latently infected cells declined dramatically after initiation of HAART but then tended to level off at a low but stable level. The biphasic decay of latent HIV in resting CD4 + T cells in acute seroconverters supports current models of pre-and postintegration latency. Latently infected CD4 T cells are an important reservoir for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [1-6]. Latently infected cells are thought to arise when productively infected CD4 T lymphoblasts escape both immune effector mechanisms and the cytopathic effects of the virus and revert to a resting memory state, in which there is little or no expression of viral genes (reviewed in [7]). These memory cells still have integrated HIV-1 provirus in their ge-nomes and are thus said to be in the postintegration phase of latency [1, 2]. A distinct form of latency, called preintegration latency, arises shortly after resting CD4 T cells are infected with HIV-1 [8]. R5 viruses can enter the subset of resting memory CD4 T cells that express sufficient levels of CCR5. In these cells, reverse transcription can proceed to completion [9], but subsequent steps in the viral life cycle do not occur because of the block in nuclear import of the preintegration complex (PIC) containing the reverse transcribed HIV-1 DNA [10]. If resting CD4 T cells in the preintegration state of latency are activated by antigen before the PIC becomes nonfunctional, nuclear import and productive infection will occur [8, 11, 12].},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at birth aims to facilitate earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected neonates. Data from two years of universal birth testing implementation in a high-burden South African urban setting are presented to demonstrate the prevalence and outcomes of diagnostic challenges in this context. METHODS: HIV-exposed neonates born at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital between 5 June 2014 and 31 August 2016 were routinely screened at birth for HIV-1 on whole blood samples using the COBAS(R) AmpliPrep/COBAS(R) TaqMan (CAP/CTM) HIV-1 Qualitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ, USA). Virological results were interpreted according to standard operating procedures with the South African National Health Laboratory Service. All neonates with non-negative results were actively followed-up and categorized according to HIV infection status as positive, negative, uncertain and lost to follow-up (LTFU). RESULTS: 104 (1.8{\%}) of 5743 HIV-exposed neonates received a non-negative birth PCR result, for which laboratory data were available for 102 (98{\%}) cases - 78 (76{\%}) tested positive and 24 (24{\%}) indeterminate. HIV infection status was confirmed positive in 83 (81{\%}) infants, negative in 8 (8{\%}), uncertain in 5 (5{\%}) and LTFU in 6 (6{\%}) cases. The positive predictive value (excluding cases of uncertain diagnosis and inadequate testing) following a non-negative HIV-1 PCR screening test at birth was 0.91 (83/91; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.85-0.96). Neonates testing positive at birth had significantly higher viral load (VL) results than those testing indeterminate at birth of 4.5 and 3.0 log copies/ml (p = 0.0007), respectively. Similarly, mothers of neonates with positive as compared to indeterminate birth test results had higher VLs of 4.5 and 2.7 log copies/ml (p = 0.0013), respectively. Half of neonates with an indeterminate birth test were shown to be HIV-infected on subsequent confirmatory testing, with time to final diagnosis 30 days longer for these neonates (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Indeterminate HIV-1 PCR results accounted for a quarter of non-negative results at birth and were associated with a high risk of infection in comparison to the risk of in utero transmission. Indeterminate birth results with positive HIV PCR results on repeat testing were associated with later final diagnosis. The HIV-1 status remains uncertain in a minority of cases because of repeatedly indeterminate results, highlighting the need for more sensitive and specific virological tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In HIV infection, the homeostasis of CD4 and CD8 T cells is $\backslash$ndramatically disturbed, and several studies have pointed out that T-cell turnover rates are $\backslash$nincreased. To understand how the CD4 and CD8 T-cell pools are affected, it is important to $\backslash$nhave quantitative insights into the lifespans of the cells constituting the different T-$\backslash$nlymphocyte populations. METHODS: We used long-term in-vivo H2O labeling and mathematical $\backslash$nmodeling to estimate the average lifespans of naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in $\backslash$nuntreated (n = 4) and combination antiretroviral therapy-treated (n = 3) HIV-1-infected $\backslash$nindividuals. RESULTS: During untreated chronic HIV-1 infection, naive CD4 and CD8 T cells $\backslash$nlived on average 618 and 271 days, whereas memory CD4 and CD8 T cells had average lifespans $\backslash$nof 53 and 43 days, respectively. These lifespans were at least three-fold shorter than those $\backslash$nin healthy controls (n = 5). In patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy $\backslash$nwith total CD4 T-cell counts in the normal range, we found that naive CD4 and CD8 T-cell $\backslash$nlifespans had not completely normalized and were still two-fold shortened. CONCLUSION: The $\backslash$naverage lifespan of both naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells decreased during untreated $\backslash$nchronic HIV-1 infection. Although the turnover of the memory T-cell populations nearly $\backslash$nnormalized during effective treatment, the turnover of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells did not $\backslash$nseem to normalize completely.},

abstract = {We develop various mathematical models of the clinical latency stage of HIV-1 infection assuming that HIV-1 infection is limited either by the availability of cells that HIV can infect or by a specific anti-HIV cellular immune response. The former models we call “target-cell-limited”. Comparing the models by phase plane analysis we find that they all belong to the class of predator-prey models. In the target-cell limited models the virus is a predator feeding upon target cell prey, while in the immune-control models the virus is a prey that is controlled by an immune response predator. Because both classes of models are of predator-prey type they behave similarly in most circumstances. We find that both types of model can account for the generic picture of disease progression in which the CD4 T cell count slowly decreases and the viral load slowly increases. Additionally, we find that both types of models can adequately describe the clinically observed changes in the plasma HIV-1 RNA loads in response to retroviral therapies.},

Clinical trials of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and switch studies involving bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide were presented. Intensification of initial ART with integrase strand transfer inhibitors did not increase the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Pharmacokinetic issues were discussed, including the substantial drug-drug interactions between efavirenz-based ART and hormonal contraception delivered via a vaginal ring. Studies on pre-ART drug resistance and emergence of drug resistance after initial and second-line ART in different settings and populations were highlighted. Novel technologies to identify drug resistance included a free, cloud-based web service for HIV genotyping analysis and a promising technology for point-of-care drug resistance mutations testing. New strategies to improve the HIV care continuum included home-based testing with initiation of same-day ART and stratified care with specialized clinics to serve those disengaged in care, but the data on financial incentives were not encouraging. Several studies provided insights into the impact of early ART on decreasing the size of the HIV reservoir in HIV-infected infants. Pertinent conference findings relating to women's health issues included similar clinical outcomes between breastfeeding and formula feeding HIV-infected women, the problem of viral rebound and ART nonadherence in pregnancy and postpartum.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Identification of HIV infection in exposed infants facilitates early therapy, which may limit viral reservoirs that maintain HIV infection under HAART. METHODS The dynamics of the resting CD4 T-cell latent HIV reservoir was determined over the first 2 years of life in 17 HIV-infected infants initiating lopinavir/ritonavir-based HAART at a median age of 8.1 weeks and achieving adequate suppression of plasma viral load by 24 weeks. RESULTS The resting CD4 T-cell latent HIV reservoir was detected in 12 of 14 (86{\%}) infants tested at 24 weeks of HAART [median frequency 1.88 infectious units per million (IUPM); range {\textless}0.22 to 81.7), and remained measurable (median IUPM = 0.32; range {\textless}0.22 to 3.25) in six of 10 (60{\%}) children retested at 96 weeks. The reservoir declined, from 24 to 96 weeks of HAART, at an estimated mean rate of 0.028 log10 IUPM/month, corresponding to a half-life of 11 months (95{\%} confidence interval 6-30 months]. A strong relationship was found between the frequency of latently infected CD4 T cells at 96 weeks of HAART and time to first undetectable plasma viral load (Spearman r = 0.91, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION Although the resting CD4 T-cell latent reservoir remains detectable over the first 2 years of HAART in a substantial proportion of infants, its size is associated with time to first undetectable viral load. To minimize HIV reservoirs in infants, rapid curtailment of viremia may limit HIV reservoirs and should be a therapeutic goal of early HAART in infants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insufficient data are available from single cohort studies to allow estimation of the prognosis of HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive patients who start highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The ART Cohort Collaboration, which includes 13 cohort studies from Europe and North America, was established to fill this knowledge gap. METHODS: We analysed data on 12,574 adult patients starting HAART with a combination of at least three drugs. Data were analysed by intention-to-continue-treatment, ignoring treatment changes and interruptions. We considered progression to a combined endpoint of a new AIDS-defining disease or death, and to death alone. The prognostic model that generalised best was a Weibull model, stratified by baseline CD4 cell count and transmission group. FINDINGS During 24,310 person-years of follow up, 1094 patients developed AIDS or died and 344 patients died. Baseline CD4 cell count was strongly associated with the probability of progression to AIDS or death: compared with patients starting HAART with less than 50 CD4 cells/microL, adjusted hazard ratios were 0.74 (95{\%} CI 0.62-0.89) for 50-99 cells/microL, 0.52 (0.44-0.63) for 100-199 cells/microL, 0.24 (0.20-0.30) for 200-349 cells/microL, and 0.18 (0.14-0.22) for 350 or more CD4 cells/microL. Baseline HIV-1 viral load was associated with a higher probability of progression only if 100,000 copies/microL or above. Other independent predictors of poorer outcome were advanced age, infection through injection-drug use, and a previous diagnosis of AIDS. The probability of progression to AIDS or death at 3 years ranged from 3.4{\%} (2.8-4.1) in patients in the lowest-risk stratum for each prognostic variable, to 50{\%} (43-58) in patients in the highest-risk strata. INTERPRETATION: The CD4 cell count at initiation was the dominant prognostic factor in patients starting HAART. Our findings have important implications for clinical management and should be taken into account in future treatment guidelines.},

abstract = {Several experiments suggest that in the chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) contribute very little to the death of productively infected cells. First, the expected life span of productively infected cells is fairly long, i.e., about 1 day. Second, this life span is hardly affected by the depletion of CD8 + T cells. Third, the rate at which mutants escaping a CTL response take over the viral population tends to be slow. Our main result is that all these observations are perfectly compatible with killing rates that are much faster than one per day once we invoke the fact that infected cells proceed through an eclipse phase of about 1 day before they start producing virus. Assuming that the major protective effect of CTL is cytolytic, we demonstrate that mathematical models with an eclipse phase account for the data when the killing is fast and when it varies over the life cycle of infected cells. Considering the steady state corresponding to the chronic phase of the infection, we find that the rate of immune escape and the rate at which the viral load increases following CD8 + T cell depletion should reflect the viral replication rate, $\rho$. A meta-analysis of previous data shows that viral replication rates during chronic infection vary between 0.5 ≤ $\rho$ ≤ 1 day −1 . Balancing such fast viral replication requires killing rates that are several times larger than $\rho$, implying that most productively infected cells would die by cytolytic effects.},

abstract = {Background: Exploring treatment response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) using viral dynamics modeling can guide therapeutic strategies. Our study aimed to understand decay dynamics of HIV-1 subtype C among Indian patients initiating first-line ART with 2NRTI + 1NNRTI-containing regimen. Methods: Patient adherence to ART was documented prospectively using pill count. CD4 count, viral load and drug resistance genotyping was performed, and HIV-1 subtyping done using two viral genes pol and env. Nonlinear mixed-effects model and mathematical modelling was used for analysis. Results: Among 270 patients initiating ART, mean age was 37yrs and 61{\%} were males.Mean baseline viral load was 5.6 log10 copies/mL and median CD4 count was 166 cells/mm3 (IQR 99, 221). Ninety-five percent of patients harboured HIV-1 subtype C. Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) was present in 9 patients (3.3{\%}). At 6 months, 88{\%} had viral load {\textless} 150 copies/mL. Patients who had TDRM had 9 times risk of non-response to therapy (p=0.01). Among patients with HIV-1C with {\textgreater}=95{\%} adherence, a biphasic viral decay pattern was seen, yielding death rate of long-lived infected cells as 0.02 d-1, corresponding to a mean lifespan of {\~{}}60 d, greater than the lifespan of {\~{}}20 d estimated with subtype B. The model predicted that in the absence of drug resistance and other confounding factors such as drug sanctuaries, adherence values as low as 40{\%} may lead to efficacies above the critical efficacy. The basic reproductive number (R0)(number of infected cells derived from any one infected cell at the beginning of the infection) was estimated as 3.8�2.2, smaller than the value predicted for HIV-1 subtype B, indicating lower pathogenicity of subtype C. Conclusions: Virological response among Indian patients taking first-line ART is excellent, but is influenced by 6-month adherence at levels lower than what was previously considered as threshold optimal levels. The Indian subtype C may be less virulent than subtype B. These results provide important insights into understanding HIV-1 C pathogenesis and planning potential therapeutic strategies.},

Time to viral suppression was 7.98 [4.6,19.3] months. Following suppression, 13 (25{\%}) children had suboptimal response [≥2 consecutive VL50-400 followed by VL{\textless}50] and/or experienced periods of virological failure [≥2 consecutive VL≥400 followed by VL{\textless}50]. Median total HIV-1 DNA was 43 [6,195] copies/106 PBMC. Younger age at therapy initiation was associated with lower total HIV-1 DNA (adjusted coefficient [AC] 0.12 per month older, p=0.0091), with a month increase in age at ART start being associated with a 13{\%} increase in HIV DNA. Similarly, a higher proportion of time spent virally suppressed (AC 0.10 per 10{\%} higher, p=0.0022) and absence of viral failure/suboptimal response (AC 0.34 for those with fail/ suboptimal response, p=0.0483) were associated with lower total HIV-1 DNA. Conclusion: Early ART initiation and a higher proportion of time suppressed are linked with lower total HIV-1 DNA. Early ART start and improving adherence in perinatally HIV-1 infected children minimize the size of viral reservoir.},

SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {It has recently been estimated that a single HIV-1 infected cell produces between and more than viral particles over its life span. Since body-wide estimates of the ratio of free virus to productively infected cells are smaller than and much smaller than , individual virions must be cleared rapidly. This seems difficult to reconcile with the fact that most of the total body virus is trapped on follicular dendritic cells where it can survive for many months. It has also been difficult to reconcile the vast difference in the rates at which the virus is cleared from the blood in rhesus macaques and in chronically infected patients. Here we attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations by considering the virion clearance rate in various organs and the virion exchange rates between them. The main results are that the per capita clearance rate of free virus in lymphoid tissue should be fast, the virion exchange rate between lymphoid tissue and the blood should be slow, and the comparatively slow previous estimates for the virion clearance rate from the blood correspond to the rate of virion efflux from the blood to other organs where the virus is ultimately cleared.},

The aim of this study was to determine treatment responses of children in a routine setting where first-line therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir is routinely included for young children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Outpatient records of children who initiated ART between April 2004 and March 2008 at a government clinic in Soweto were reviewed. Children {\textless}3 years initiated ART with lopinavir/ritonavir and those ≥ 3 years initiated with efavirenz-containing regimens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: ART was initiated at a median age of 4.3 years, 28.6{\%} also received tuberculosis treatment. During 3155 child-years of follow-up (median follow-up 17 months), 132 children (6{\%}) died giving a mortality rate of 4.2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 3.5, 5.0) deaths per 100 child-years. By 12 and 24 months, 84{\%} and 96{\%} of children achieved virologic suppression. The proportion of children with viral rebound increased from 5.4{\%} to 16.3{\%} at 24 and 36 months from start of ART. Younger children (receiving lopinavir/ritonavir-based first-line therapy) with higher viral loads suppressed more slowly and were more likely to die. Children who were started on treatment for tuberculosis at the time of viral suppression were more likely to have virologic rebound.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Despite good treatment outcomes overall, children with advanced disease at ART initiation had poorer outcomes, particularly those {\textless}3 years of age, most of whom were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir-containing therapy. The increasing risk of viral rebound over time for the whole cohort is concerning, given currently limited available treatment options for children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modeling of virus dynamics has provided quantitative insights into viral infections such as influenza, the simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R0). To calculate R0 from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required. This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data. Here, we propose two new models that can reliably estimate the average life span of infected cells from acute-phase data, and apply both methods to experimental data from humanized mice infected with HIV-1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Both new models, called as the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model, are derived by simplification of a standard model for the acute-phase dynamics of target cells, viruses and infected cells. By having only a limited number of parameters, both models allow us to reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells. Simulated datasets with plausible parameter values are generated with the standard model to compare the performance of the new models with that of the major previous model (i.e., the simple exponential model). Finally, we fit models to time course data from HIV-1 infected humanized mice to estimate the several important parameters characterizing their acute infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new models provided much better estimates than the previous model because they more precisely capture the de novo infection process. Both models describe the acute phase of HIV-1 infected humanized mice reasonably well, and we estimated an average death rate of infected cells of 0.61 and 0.61, an average exponential growth rate of 0.69 and 0.76, and an average basic reproduction number of 2.30 and 2.38 in the RQS model and the PWR model, respectively. These estimates are fairly close to those obtained in humans.},

To compare clinical, serologic, cellular, and virologic markers for their ability to predict progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death during a 10-year period. Prospective, multicenter cohort study. Four university-based clinical centers participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. 1604 men infected with HIV-1. The markers compared were oral candidiasis (thrush) or fever; serum neopterin levels; serum beta 2-microglobulin levels; number and percentage of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes; and plasma viral load, which was measured as the concentration of HIV-1 RNA found using a sensitive branched-DNA signal-amplification assay. Plasma viral load was the single best predictor of progression to AIDS and death, followed (in order of predictive strength) by CD4+ lymphocyte count and serum neopterin levels, serum beta 2-microglobulin levels, and thrush or fever. Plasma viral load discriminated risk at all levels of CD4+ lymphocyte counts and predicted their subsequent rate of decline. Five risk categories were defined by plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations: 500 copies/mL or less, 501 to 3000 copies/mL, 3001 to 10000 copies/mL, 10001 to 30000 copies/mL, and more than 30000 copies/mL. Highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001) differences in the percentages of participants who progressed to AIDS within 6 years were seen in the five risk categories: 5.4{\%}, 16.6{\%}, 31.7{\%}, 55.2{\%}, and 80.0{\%}, respectively. Highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001) differences in the percentages of participants who died of AIDS within 6 years were also seen in the five risk categories: 0.9{\%}, 6.3{\%}, 18.1{\%}, 34.9{\%}, and 69.5{\%}, respectively. A regression tree incorporating both HIV-1 RNA measurements and CD4+ lymphocyte counts provided better discrimination of outcome than did either marker alone; use of both variables defined categories of risk for AIDS within 6 years that ranged from less than 2{\%} to 98{\%}. Plasma viral load strongly predicts the rate of decrease in CD4+ lymphocyte count and progression to AIDS and death, but the prognosis of HIV-infected persons is more accurately defined by combined measurement of plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ lymphocytes},

In this study, we show that the physiologic lymphopenic environment existing in neonatal mice also supports CD4 T cell proliferation. Strikingly, naive CD4 T cells that proliferate within neonates acquire the phenotypic and functional characteristics of memory cells. Such proliferation is inhibited by the presence of both memory and naive CD4 T cells, is enhanced by 3-day thymectomy, is independent of IL-7, and requires a class II MHC-TCR interaction and a CD28-mediated signal. CD44bright CD4 T cells in neonates have a wide repertoire as judged by the distribution of V$\beta$ expression. Thus, lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation is a physiologic process that occurs during the early postnatal period.},

abstract = {Background: Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. Findings: At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 72{\textperiodcentered}5–74{\textperiodcentered}1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}9–19{\textperiodcentered}6), and injuries 8{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7–8{\textperiodcentered}2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}5–23{\textperiodcentered}9), representing an additional 7{\textperiodcentered}61 million (7{\textperiodcentered}20–8{\textperiodcentered}01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}0–8{\textperiodcentered}8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (20{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}0) and the death rate by 31{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (30{\textperiodcentered}1–33{\textperiodcentered}3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}5–4{\textperiodcentered}0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}2–15{\textperiodcentered}1) to 57{\textperiodcentered}9 deaths (55{\textperiodcentered}9–59{\textperiodcentered}2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000–363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (88{\textperiodcentered}8–148{\textperiodcentered}6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (32{\textperiodcentered}2–40{\textperiodcentered}6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (31{\textperiodcentered}2–36{\textperiodcentered}1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Recent goals of antiretroviral treatment of neonates have expanded from reducing morbidity and mortality to also aiming to facilitate HIV remission. Areas covered: In this review, we present and discuss the rationale and evidence-bases for each of these distinct goals. Next we discuss the challenges of how to identify HIV-infected neonates. Finally, we discuss the specific antiretroviral drugs that are preferred for this group, making distinctions between the use of these agents in prevention and treatment. Expert commentary: The clinical and scientific challenges of pharmacological treatment of acute HIV infection in neonates are complicated by externalities beyond biology. At the same time, these challenges are energized by the unique biological opportunities afforded by investigating this population, including a unique immune profile, ability to study both mother and neonate as well as transmitted and acquired virus, and time period spanning both the period soon after infection as well as the period of viral reservoir establishment and related damage. Given the unique scientific opportunities afforded by study of pharmacologic treatment of acute HIV infection in neonates, we hypothesize that over the next five years breakthroughs may occur that may lead to new interventions effective at achieving HIV remission.},

We examined time to viral suppression and CD8 cell activation in relation to baseline participant characteristics. We compared time to viral suppression and viral dynamics using linear mixed-effects models between acutely infected participants and chronically infected controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Between January 2005 and May 2009, 61 AHI participants were enrolled. Of participants whose enrollment date allowed 24 and 48 weeks of follow-up, 47 of 51 (92{\%}) achieved viral suppression to less than 200 copies/ml by week 24, and 35 of 41 (85.4{\%}) to less than 50 copies/ml by week 48. The median time from ART initiation to suppression below 50 copies/ml was 93 days (range 14-337). Higher HIV RNA levels at ART initiation (P = 0.02), but not time from estimated date of infection to ART initiation (P = 0.86), were associated with longer time to viral suppression. The median baseline frequency of activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells was 67{\%} (range 40-95), and was not significantly associated with longer time to viral load suppression (P = 0.15). Viremia declined to less than 50 copies/ml more rapidly in AHI than chronically infected participants. Mixed-model analysis demonstrated similar phase I HIV RNA decay rates between acute and chronically infected participants, and more rapid viral decline in acutely infected participants in phase II.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Once-daily emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz initiated during AHI achieves rapid and sustained HIV suppression during this highly infectious period.},

Studies to evaluate CD4 count in vertically exposed, but human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative infants from this region have not been done previously. The aim of this study was to determine the reference values of CD4 counts, percentages and temporal profile in vertically exposed HIV negative infants residing in this environment. Methodology: Blood samples were auto-analyzed using hematology machine made by Point Care Technologies, Inc. (Marlborough, MA, USA). All data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences 15.0 for Windows™. Median and 10 th and 90 th percentiles of CD4 cells were determined and analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and Kendall's non-parametric correlations. P ≤0.05 values were considered to be significant. Results: The values of CD4 counts in the infants studied were higher compared with adults. The values of CD4 count, {\%}CD4 and their normal ranges were statistically the same for male and female sexes and within all age categories under 1 year. Although absolute CD4 cell count remained fairly constant from birth to the age of 1 year, {\%}CD4 decreased gradually from birth toward the age of one. Conclusions: For the first time in this environment, our study has reported absolute and percentage CD4 count, which were similar to those reported from other African studies. The results support the use of the same reference values for resident male and female infants for clinical decision making.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa reside in rural areas, yet most research on treatment outcomes has been conducted in urban centers. Rural clinics and residents may face unique barriers to care and treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study of HIV-infected children was conducted between September 2007 and September 2010 at the rural HIV clinic in Macha, Zambia. HIV-infected children younger than 16 years of age at study enrollment who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study were eligible. Treatment outcomes during the first two years of ART, including mortality, immunologic status, and virologic suppression, were assessed and risk factors for mortality and virologic suppression were evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 69 children entered the study receiving ART and 198 initiated ART after study enrollment. The cumulative probabilities of death among children starting ART after study enrollment were 9.0{\%} and 14.4{\%} at 6 and 24 months after ART initiation. Younger age, higher viral load, lower CD4+ T-cell percentage and lower weight-for-age z-scores at ART initiation were associated with higher risk of mortality. The mean CD4(+) T-cell percentage increased from 16.3{\%} at treatment initiation to 29.3{\%} and 35.0{\%} at 6 and 24 months. The proportion of children with undetectable viral load increased to 88.5{\%} and 77.8{\%} at 6 and 24 months. Children with longer travel times (≥ 5 hours) and those taking nevirapine at ART initiation, as well as children who were non-adherent, were less likely to achieve virologic suppression after 6 months of ART.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected children receiving treatment in a rural clinic experienced sustained immunologic and virologic improvements. Children with longer travel times were less likely to achieve virologic suppression, supporting the need for decentralized models of ART delivery.},

abstract = {HIV type 1 (HIV-1) persists within resting CD4(+) T cells despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). To better understand the kinetics by which resting cell infection (RCI) is established, we developed a mathematical model that accurately predicts (r = 0.65, P = 2.5 × 10(-4)) the initial frequency of RCI measured about 1 year postinfection, based on the time of ART initiation and the dynamic changes in viremia and CD4(+) T cells. In the largest cohort of patients treated during acute seronegative HIV infection (AHI) in whom RCI has been stringently quantified, we found that early ART reduced the generation of latently infected cells. Although RCI declined after the first year of ART in most acutely infected patients, there was a striking absence of decline when initial RCI frequency was less than 0.5 per million. Notably, low-level viremia was observed more frequently as RCI increased. Together these observations suggest that (i) the degree of RCI is directly related to the availability of CD4(+) T cells susceptible to HIV, whether viremia is controlled by the immune response and/or ART; and (ii) that two pools of infected resting CD4(+) T cells exist, namely, less stable cells, observable in patients in whom viremia is not well controlled in early infection, and extremely stable cells that are established despite early ART. These findings reinforce and extend the concept that new approaches will be needed to eradicate HIV infection, and, in particular, highlight the need to target the extremely small but universal, long-lived latent reservoir.},

In this review, we compile published estimates of CTL-mediated death rates, and examine whether these studies permit determining the rate at which CTLs kill HIV-1 infected cells. We highlight potential misinterpretations of the CTL-killing rates from the escape rates of mutants, and from perturbations of the steady state viral load during chronic infection. Our major conclusion is that CTL-mediated killing rates remain unknown. But contrary to current consensus, we argue that killing rates higher than one per day are perfectly consistent with the experimental data, which would imply that the majority of the productively infected cells could still die from CTL-mediated killing rather than from viral cytopathicity.},

abstract = {Analysis of changes in viral load after initiation of treatment with potent antiretroviral agents has provided substantial insight into the dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The concentration of HIV-1 in plasma drops by approximately 99{\%} in the first two weeks of treatment owing to the rapid elimination of free virus with a half-life (t1/2) of {\textless} or =6 hours and loss of productively infected cells with a t1/2 of 1.6 days. Here we show that with combination therapy this initial decrease is followed by a slower second-phase decay of plasma viraemia. Detailed mathematical analysis shows that the loss of long-lived infected cells (t1/2 of 1-4 weeks) is a major contributor to the second phase, whereas the activation of latently infected lymphocytes (t1/2 of 0.5-2 weeks) is only a minor source. Based on these decay characteristics, we estimate that 2.3-3.1 years of a completely inhibitory treatment would be required to eliminate HIV-1 from these compartments. To eradicate HIV-1 completely, even longer treatment may be needed because of the possible existence of undetected viral compartments or sanctuary sites.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-dose nevirapine is the cornerstone of the regimen for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in resource-limited settings, but nevirapine frequently selects for resistant virus in mothers and children who become infected despite prophylaxis. The optimal antiretroviral treatment strategy for children who have had prior exposure to single-dose nevirapine is unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of initial therapy with zidovudine and lamivudine plus either nevirapine or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in HIV-infected children 6 to 36 months of age, in six African countries, who qualified for treatment according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results are reported for the cohort that included children exposed to single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis. The primary end point was virologic failure or discontinuation of treatment by study week 24. Enrollment in this cohort was terminated early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 164 children were enrolled. The median percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes was 19{\%}; a total of 56{\%} of the children had WHO stage 3 or 4 disease. More children in the nevirapine group than in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group reached a primary end point (39.6{\%} vs. 21.7{\%}; weighted difference, 18.6 percentage-points; 95{\%} confidence interval, 3.7 to 33.6; nominal P=0.02). Baseline resistance to nevirapine was detected in 18 of 148 children (12{\%}) and was predictive of treatment failure. No significant between-group differences were seen in the rate of adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n CONCLUSIONS: Among children with prior exposure to single-dose nevirapine for perinatal prevention of HIV transmission, antiretroviral treatment consisting of zidovudine and lamivudine plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir resulted in better outcomes than did treatment with zidovudine and lamivudine plus nevirapine. Since nevirapine is used for both treatment and perinatal prevention of HIV infection in resource-limited settings, alternative strategies for the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child, as well as for the treatment of HIV infection, are urgently required.

abstract = {This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4 1 lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA 1 CD62L 1), and memory (CD45RA 2 CD45RO 1) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including bipha-sic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4 1 cell response, while 44{\%} of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4 1 cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4 1 cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4 1 cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4 1 and total CD4 1 cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4 1 cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4 1 cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4 1 cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58{\%}) than patients with nondecay patterns (24{\%}). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4 1 and memory CD4 1 cell number (but not naive CD4 1 cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lym-phocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the "classic" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment. 1231},

Our results indicate that some young infants, and even the fetus, seem to be capable of generating virus-specific CTL responses. The detection of HIV-1-specific CTL responses varied among infants, however, with respect to timing, HIV-1 gene product recognition, and the magnitude of detectable responses; HIV-1-specific CTL responses were uncommonly detected in the first few months of life. The less consistent detection of HIV-specific CTL in early infancy contrasts with reports of the detection of HIV-1-specific CTL soon after primary infection in adults. HIV-1-specific CTL were not detected in any uninfected infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women. This description of HIV-1-specific CTL in infants may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of vertical HIV-1 infection and for the development of a vaccine to interrupt vertical infection.},

abstract = {Background. In chronic HIV-1 infection, dynamic equilibrium exists between viral production and clearance. The half-life of free virions can be estimated by inhibiting virion production with antiretroviral agents and modelling the resulting decline in plasma HIV-1 RNA. To define HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) dynamics, we used plasma apheresis to increase virion clearance temporarily while leaving virion production unaffected. Methods. Plasma virus loads were measured frequently before, during, and after apheresis in four HIV-1-infected patients, two of whom were also co-infected with HCV. Rates of virion clearance were derived by non-linear least-square fitting of plasma virus load to a model of viral dynamics. Findings. Virion clearance rate constants were 0.0063/min (9.1/day) to 0.025/min (36.0/day; half-life 28-110 min) for HIV-1 and 0.0038/min (5.5/day) to 0.0069/min (9.9/day; half-life 100-182 min) for HCV. These values provided estimates of daily particle production of 9.3 log10-10.2 log10particles for HIV-1 and 11.6 log10-13.0 log10particles for HCV. Interpretation. Our findings confirm that HIV-1 and HCV are produced and cleared extremely rapidly. New estimates for HIV-1 clearance are up to ten times higher than previous ones, whereas HCV clearance is similar to previous estimates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) generally suppresses the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but does not cure the infection, because proviruses persist in stable latent reservoirs. It has been proposed that low-level proviral reservoirs might predict longer virologic control after discontinuation of treatment. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of very early initiation of cART and temporary treatment interruption on the size of the latent HIV-1 reservoir in vertically infected children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This retrospective study included 23 perinatally HIV-1-infected children who initiated very early treatment within 12 weeks after birth (n = 14), or early treatment between week 12 and 1 year (n = 9). We measured the proviral reservoir (CD4(+) T-cell-associated HIV-1 DNA) in blood samples collected beyond the first year of sustained virologic suppression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There is a strong positive correlation between the time to initiation of cART and the size of the proviral reservoir. Children who initiated cART within the first 12 weeks of life showed a proviral reservoir 6-fold smaller than children initiating cART beyond this time (P {\textless} .01). Rapid virologic control after initiation of cART also limits the size of the viral reservoir. However, patients who underwent transient treatment interruptions showed a dramatic increase in the size of the viral reservoir after discontinuation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Initiation of cART during the first 12 weeks of life in perinatally HIV-1-infected children limits the size of the viral reservoir. Treatment interruptions should be undertaken with caution, as they might lead to fast and irreversible replenishment of the viral reservoir.},

Nevirapine resistance after exposure to the drug for prevention of maternal-to-child human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is common, a problem that has led to the recommendation of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in such settings. Regardless of whether there has been prior exposure to nevirapine, the performance of nevirapine versus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in young children has not been rigorously established.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In a randomized trial conducted in six African countries and India, we compared the initiation of HIV treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in HIV-infected children 2 to 36 months of age who had no prior exposure to nevirapine. The primary end point was virologic failure or discontinuation of treatment by study week 24.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 288 children were enrolled; the median percentage of CD4+ T cells was 15{\%}, and the median plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level was 5.7 log(10) copies per milliliter. The percentage of children who reached the primary end point was significantly higher in the nevirapine group than in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (40.8{\%} vs. 19.3{\%}; P{\textless}0.001). Among the nevirapine-treated children with virologic failure for whom data on resistance were available, more than half (19 of 32) had resistance at the time of virologic failure. In addition, the time to a protocol-defined toxicity end point was shorter in the nevirapine group (P=0.04), as was the time to death (P=0.06).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were superior with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir among young children with no prior exposure to nevirapine. Factors that may have contributed to the suboptimal results with nevirapine include elevated viral load at baseline, selection for nevirapine resistance, background regimen of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and the standard ramp-up dosing strategy.

abstract = {To understand the role of the immune system in limiting HIV type 1 replication, it is critical to know to what extent the rapid turnover of productively infected cells is caused by viral cytopathicity or by immune-mediated lysis. We show that uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells of many patients contain cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that lyse target cells-at plausible peripheral blood mononuclear cell-to-target ratios-with half-lives of less than 1 day. In 23 patients with CD4 counts ranging from 10 to 900 per microliter, the average rate of CTL-mediated lysis corresponds to a target cell half- life of 0.7 day. We develop mathematical models to calculate the turnover rate of infected cells subjected to immune-mediated lysis and viral cytopathicity and to estimate the fraction of cells that are killed by CTL as opposed to virus. The models provide new interpretations of drug treatment dynamics and explain why the observed rate of virus decline is roughly constant for different patients. We conclude that in HIV type 1 infection, CTL-mediated lysis can reduce virus load by limiting virus production, with small effects on the half- life of infected cells.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether relative and absolute values of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratio change in relation to age, and to estimate the fifth and 95th percentiles for these values in children of various ages. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets was performed on blood samples from 208 healthy children, aged 1 through 59 months, using standard flow cytometric techniques. RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts declined significantly with advancing age (P less than .000001 and P = .03, respectively). Since CD4 and CD8 counts depend on total lymphocyte count, the percentage of total lymphocytes of each phenotype was also analyzed and demonstrated that the CD4 percentage was highly age dependent (P less than .000001). The CD8 percentage increased with age (P = .0001) but not as much as the CD4 percentage decreased. Median CD4 counts (fifth and 95th percentiles) for children 2 through 3, 4 through 8, 12 through 23, and 24 through 59 months of age were 2.83 (1.46 to 5.11), 2.95 (1.69 to 4.61), 2.07 (1.02 to 3.60), and 1.80 (0.90 to 2.86) x 10(9)/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Healthy children's CD4 lymphocyte counts are considerably higher than previously established adult values. These data demonstrate that age is an important consideration in interpretation of lymphocyte subsets in children. This may be especially relevant in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, where CD4 lymphocyte values play a central role in monitoring disease progression and determining thresholds for medical interventions.},

We investigated antiretroviral-treatment strategies in the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) trial. METHODS: HIV-infected infants 6 to 12 weeks of age with a CD4 lymphocyte percentage (the CD4 percentage) of 25{\%} or more were randomly assigned to receive antiretroviral therapy (lopinavir-ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine) when the CD4 percentage decreased to less than 20{\%} (or 25{\%} if the child was younger than 1 year) or clinical criteria were met (the deferred antiretroviral-therapy group) or to immediate initiation of limited antiretroviral therapy until 1 year of age or 2 years of age (the early antiretroviral-therapy groups). We report the early outcomes for infants who received deferred antiretroviral therapy as compared with early antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: At a median age of 7.4 weeks (interquartile range, 6.6 to 8.9) and a CD4 percentage of 35.2{\%} (interquartile range, 29.1 to 41.2), 125 infants were randomly assigned to receive deferred therapy, and 252 infants were randomly assigned to receive early therapy. After a median follow-up of 40 weeks (interquartile range, 24 to 58), antiretroviral therapy was initiated in 66{\%} of infants in the deferred-therapy group. Twenty infants in the deferred-therapy group (16{\%}) died versus 10 infants in the early-therapy groups (4{\%}) (hazard ratio for death, 0.24; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.51; P{\textless}0.001). In 32 infants in the deferred-therapy group (26{\%}) versus 16 infants in the early-therapy groups (6{\%}), disease progressed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage C or severe stage B (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.25; 95{\%} CI, 0.15 to 0.41; P{\textless}0.001). Stavudine was substituted for zidovudine in four infants in the early-therapy groups because of neutropenia in three infants and anemia in one infant; no drugs were permanently discontinued. After a review by the data and safety monitoring board, the deferred-therapy group was modified, and infants in this group were all reassessed for initiation of antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Early HIV diagnosis and early antiretroviral therapy reduced early infant mortality by 76{\%} and HIV progression by 75{\%}. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00102960.)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally in pediatric HIV, the CD4+ T-lymphocyte percent is used to monitor disease progression because of the variability in absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte numbers. Because of the high cost of equipment, sophisticated and delicate technology, most laboratories in resource-limited settings use simple protocols that enumerate only the absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. We assessed the use of absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count as a surrogate marker of pediatric HIV disease progression. METHODS: We analyzed the CD4+ T-lymphocytes and HIV viral load over a 10-year period (1996-2006) of 97 HIV-infected children enrolled in the Yale Prospective Longitudinal Pediatric HIV Cohort using generalized linear mixed models. Both CD4+ T-lymphocytes and HIV viral load were assessed at baseline and every 2-3 months. The modeling approach used in this study allows the intercept and the rate at which outcome variables change over time to vary across participants. RESULTS: We determined that absolute CD4+ T-lymphocytes count was just as reliable at monitoring pediatric HIV as CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage. Antiretroviral treatment, regardless of the regimen used, was associated with higher CD+ T-lymphocytes count (P {\textless} 0.01). Race was significantly associated with CD4+ T-lymphocytes counts (with lower values for blacks compared with nonblacks; P {\textless} 0.01). The presence of other infections was associated with lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (P = 0.01) and higher viral load (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In situations where determination of CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentages is not readily available, the absolute count may provide an affordable and accessible laboratory surrogate marker of HIV disease progression in children.},

abstract = {To study the kinetics of lymphocytes, models have divided the cell population into subpopu-lations with different turnover rates. These have been called 'kinetic heterogeneity models' so as to distinguish them from 'temporal heterogeneity models', in which a cell population may have different turnover rates at different times, e.g. when resting versus when activated. We model labelling curves for temporally heterogeneous populations, and predict that they exhibit equal biphasic up-and downslopes. We show when cells divide only once upon activation, these slopes are dominated by the slowest exponent, yielding underestimates of the average turnover rate. When cells undergo more than one division, the labelling curves allow fitting of the two exponential slopes in the temporal heterogeneity model. The same data can also be described with a two-compartment kinetic heterogeneity model. In both instances, the average turnover rate is correctly estimated. Because both models assume a different cell biology but describe the data equally well, the parameters of either model have no simple biological interpretation, as each parameter could reflect a combination of parameters of another biological process. Thus, even if there are sufficient data to reliably estimate all exponentials, one can only accurately estimate an average turnover rate. We illustrate these issues by re-fitting labelling data from healthy and HIV-infected individuals.},

abstract = {Viral dynamics were intensively investigated in eight patients with acute HIV infection to define the earliest rates of change in plasma HIV RNA before and after the start of antiretroviral therapy. We report the first estimates of the basic reproductive number (R(0)), the number of cells infected by the progeny of an infected cell during its lifetime when target cells are not depleted. The mean initial viral doubling time was 10 h, and the peak of viremia occurred 21 d after reported HIV exposure. The spontaneous rate of decline (alpha) was highly variable among individuals. The phase 1 viral decay rate (delta(I) = 0.3/day) in subjects initiating potent antiretroviral therapy during acute HIV infection was similar to estimates from treated subjects with chronic HIV infection. The doubling time in two subjects who discontinued antiretroviral therapy was almost five times slower than during acute infection. The mean basic reproductive number (R(0)) of 19.3 during the logarithmic growth phase of primary HIV infection suggested that a vaccine or postexposure prophylaxis of at least 95{\%} efficacy would be needed to extinguish productive viral infection in the absence of drug resistance or viral latency. These measurements provide a basis for comparison of vaccine and other strategies and support the validity of the simian immunodeficiency virus macaque model of acute HIV infection.},

Here we advance an alternative explanation based on the immune response against a single population of infected cells. We show that the biphasic decay can be explained simply, without invoking multiple compartments: viral load falls quickly while cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are still abundant, and more slowly as CTL disappear. We propose a method to test this idea, and develop a framework that is readily applicable to treatment of other infections.},

Among HIV-infected infants living in resource constrained settings, the short and long term benefits of ART are only partially known. This study was designed to determine the virologic, immunologic and clinical outcomes of antiretroviral therapy in a cohort of HIV-infected infants receiving care from an outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A prospective cohort of HIV-infected infants receiving treatment at the Baylor-Uganda clinic was analyzed. Patients were diagnosed, enrolled and followed up at the clinic. HIV viral load, CD4 cell counts and clinical progress were assessed during follow-up. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling to determine predictors of treatment success were conducted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 91 HIV-infected infants enrolled into the cohort, 53 (58.2{\%}) infants were female; 43 (47.3{\%}) were 6 months of age or younger, and 50 (55.6{\%}) had advanced HIV/AIDS disease (Clinical stage 3 or 4). Eighty four infants started ART and 78 (92.9{\%}) completed 6 months of treatments. Fifty six (71.8{\%}) infants attained virologic suppression by month-6 of ART, and at month-12 of ART, the cumulative probability of attaining viral suppression was 83.1{\%}. None of the baseline infant factors (age, sex, WHO stage, CD4 cell percent, weight for age, or height for age z-score) predicted treatment success. There was an increase in CD4 cells from a baseline mean of 23{\%} to 30{\%} at month-6 of treatment (p{\textless}0.001) and by month-24 of ART, the mean CD4 percent was 36{\%}. A total of 7 patients died while on ART and another 7 experienced adverse events that were related to treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results show that, even among very young patients from resource constrained settings, ART dramatically suppresses HIV replication, allows immune recovery and clinical improvement, and is safe. However, baseline characteristics do not predict recovery in this age group.},

abstract = {Despite the clinical benefits of combination antiviral therapy, whether maximal antiviral potency has been achieved with current drug combinations remains unclear. We studied the first phase of decay of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in plasma, one early indicator of antiviral activity, after the administration of a novel combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and lamivudine and compared it with that observed in matched cohorts treated with alternative combination regimens. On the basis of these comparisons, we conclude that the relative potency of highly active antiretroviral therapy may be augmented by as much as 25{\%}-30{\%}. However, it is important to emphasize that further study is warranted to explore whether these early measurements of relative efficacy provide long-term virologic and clinical benefits. Nevertheless, we believe that optimal treatment regimens for HIV-1 have yet to be identified and that continued research to achieve this goal is warranted},

abstract = {During primary infection, the number of HIV-1 particles in plasma increases rapidly, reaches a peak, and then declines until it reaches a set point level. Understanding the kinetics of primary infection, and its effect on the establishment of chronic infection, is important in defining the early pathogenesis of HIV. We studied the viral dynamics of very early HIV-1 infection in 47 subjects identified through plasma donation screening. We calculated how fast the viral load increases and how variable this parameter is among individuals. We also estimated the basic reproductive ratio, the number of new infected cells generated by an infectious cell at the start of infection when target cells are not limiting. The initial viral doubling time had a median of 0.65 days with an interquartile range of 0.56 to 0.91 days. The median basic reproductive ratio was 8.0 with an interquartile range of 4.9 to 11. In 15 patients, we also observed the postpeak decay of plasma virus and found that the virus decay occurred at a median rate of 0.60 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.2 days. The median peak viral load was 5.8 log(10) HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, and it was reached 14 days after the virus was quantifiable with an assay, with a lower limit of detection of 50 copies/ml. These results characterize the early plasma viral dynamics in acute HIV infection better than it has been possible thus far. They also better define the challenge that the immune response (or therapeutic intervention) has to overcome to defeat HIV at this early stage.},

Viral dynamics in HIV-1-infected individuals aged 12-22 years were similar to those of HIV-1-infected adults and infants. Individuals who received 3TC/ZDV/EFV had a more rapid phase 1 viral decay rate than those who received 3TC/ZDV/NFV or other regimens. Phase 1 viral decay rates were positively correlated with baseline RNA levels and week 1 virus load reductions. Our findings indicate that the 3TC/ZDV/EFV regimen may be more potent than 3TC/ZDV/NFV or other regimens and that early viral dynamics or week 1 virus load reduction measurements may be useful in evaluating the potency of antiretroviral regimens.},

From 22 patients with initial Taqman v2.0 based VLs exceeding 500 copies/mL, 6 patients had VLs {\textless}20 copies/mL after novel VL measurement on a next visit. In our control group with VL quantification using the Abbott RT assay, only 1 patient became detectable and showed a VL of {\textless}40 copies/mL after new measurement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Transition to the Taqman v2.0 assay was accompanied by an increase of quantifiable HIV-1 VLs in patients with long term viral suppression under antiretroviral therapy that might be attributed to technical shortcomings of the Taqman v2.0 assay. A high test variability at the low VL end but also beyond was observed, making meaningful clinical interpretation of viral blips derived from different assays difficult.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Model trajectories of viral load measurements from time of starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and use the model to predict whether patients will achieve suppressed viral load ({\textless}/=200 copies/ml) within 6-months of starting cART. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study including HIV-positive adults (UK Collaborative HIV Cohort Study). METHODS: Eligible patients were antiretroviral naive and started cART after 1997. Random effects models were used to estimate viral load trends. Patients were randomly selected to form a validation dataset with those remaining used to fit the model. We evaluated predictions of suppression using indices of diagnostic test performance. RESULTS: Of 9562 eligible patients 6435 were used to fit the model and 3127 for validation. Mean log10 viral load trajectories declined rapidly during the first 2 weeks post-cART, moderately between 2 weeks and 3 months, and more slowly thereafter. Higher pretreatment viral load predicted steeper declines, whereas older age, white ethnicity, and boosted protease inhibitor/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based cART-regimen predicted a steeper decline from 3 months onwards. Specificity of predictions and the diagnostic odds ratio substantially improved when predictions were based on viral load measurements up to the 4-month visit compared with the 2 or 3-month visits. Diagnostic performance improved when suppression was defined by two consecutive suppressed viral loads compared with one. CONCLUSIONS: Viral load measurements can be used to predict if a patient will be suppressed by 6-month post-cART. Graphical presentations of this information could help clinicians decide the optimum time to switch treatment regimen during the first months of cART.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) markedly reduces the risk of HIV-1 transmission in serodiscordant partnerships. We previously found that younger age and higher CD4 counts were associated with delayed initiation of ART by HIV-1-infected partners in serodiscordant partnerships. Among those initiating ART, we sought to explore whether those same factors were associated with failure to achieve viral suppression. METHODS: In a prospective study of HIV-1-infected persons who had a known heterosexual HIV-1-uninfected partner in Kenya and Uganda [Partners Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Study], we used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate correlates of viral nonsuppression (HIV-1 RNA {\textgreater}80 copies/ml). RESULTS: Of 1,035 HIV-1-infected participants initiating ART, 867 (84{\%}) achieved viral suppression: 77{\%} by 6 months and 86{\%} by 12 months. Younger age [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05 for every 5 years younger; p = .006], lower pretreatment CD4 count (aHR 1.26; p = .009 for {\textless}/=250 compared with {\textgreater}250 cells/mul), and higher pretreatment HIV-1 RNA quantity (aHR 1.21 per log10; p {\textless} .001) independently predicted failure to achieve viral suppression. Following initial viral suppression, 8.8{\%} (76/867) experienced virologic rebound (HIV-1 RNA {\textgreater}200 copies/ml): 6.3{\%} and 11.5{\%} by 6 and 12 months after initial suppression, respectively. Age was the only factor associated with increased risk of virologic rebound (aHR 1.33 for every 5 years younger; p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: For HIV-1-infected persons in serodiscordant couples, younger age was associated with delayed ART initiation, failure to achieve viral suppression, and increased risk of virologic rebound. Motivating ART initiation and early adherence is a key to achieving and sustaining viral suppression.},

Thirty-nine percent of the 105 children with HIV infection died during the study period, compared with 5.0{\%} of the 260 HIV-seropositive but uninfected children and 1.6{\%} of the 127 HIV-seronegative children. Estimated survival probabilities from 9 through 36 months of age were 52{\%} among HIV-infected children, 95{\%} among initially HIV-seropositive but uninfected children, and 98{\%} among HIV-seronegative children. In multivariable analyses, history of a clinic visit within the 4 weeks prior to study entry (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-13.5), hemoglobin level {\textless}8 g/dL at study entry (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.4; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-12.6), and CD4(+) T lymphocyte percentage {\textless}15{\%} at study entry (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.2; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-9.5) were associated with mortality among HIV-infected children. CONCLUSIONS Only approximately one-half of HIV-infected Zambian children who were alive at 9 months of age survived to 3 years of age, supporting the urgent need for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and the early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in children in sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in resource-limited countries, with limited capacity for CD4 and HIV viral load monitoring, presents a unique challenge. We determined the effectiveness of first-line ART in a real world pediatric HIV clinic and explored associations between readily obtainable patient data and the trajectories of change in CD4 count and HIV viral load. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study of a cohort of HIV-infected children initiating ART at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Pediatric HIV clinic in Accra, Ghana, aged 0-13 years from 2009-2012. CD4 and viral load testing were done every 4 to 6 months and genotypic resistance testing was performed for children failing therapy. A mixed linear modeling approach, combining fixed and random subject effects, was employed for data analysis. Results: Ninety HIV-infected children aged 0 to 13 years initiating ART were enrolled. The effectiveness of first-line regimen among study participants was 83.3{\%}, based on WHO criteria for virologic failure. Fifteen of the 90 (16.7{\%}) children met the criteria for virologic treatment failure after at least 24 weeks on ART. Sixty-seven percent virologic failures harbored viruses with {\textgreater} 1 drug resistant mutations (DRMs); M184V/K103N was the predominant resistance pathway. Age at initiation of therapy, child's gender, having a parent as a primary care giver, severity of illness, and type of regimen were associated with treatment outcomes. Conclusions: First-line ART regimens were effective and well tolerated. We identified predictors of the trajectories of change in CD4 and viral load to inform targeted laboratory monitoring of ART among HIV-infected children in resource-limited countries. 2013 Barry et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {CD8+T cells contribute to the control of HIV, but it is not clear whether initial immune responses modulate the viral set point. We screened high-risk uninfected women twice a week for plasma HIV RNA and identified 12 hyperacute infections. Onset of viremia elicited a massive HIV-specific CD8+T cell response, with limited bystander activation of non-HIV memory CD8+T cells. HIV-specific CD8+T cells secreted little interferon-$\gamma$, underwent rapid apoptosis, and failed to upregulate the interleukin-7 receptor, known to be important for T cell survival. The rapidity to peak CD8+T cell activation and the absolute magnitude of activation induced by the exponential rise in viremia were inversely correlated with set point viremia. These data indicate that rapid, high magnitude HIV-induced CD8+T cell responses are crucial for subsequent immune control of acute infection, which has important implications for HIV vaccine design.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the optimal time point for the initiation of therapy in HIV infection from the perspective of drug resistance. BACKGROUND: The enormous genetic diversity of HIV within an infected individual represents one of the greatest challenges for effective therapy, because the viral population may harbour drug-resistant mutants that rapidly outgrow the wild-type virus once the patient starts treatment. To determine the optimal timing of therapy it is crucial to know how long it takes for the viral population to build up sufficient diversity to enable the virus to escape from therapy. METHOD: A stochastic model of the viral diversification during primary infection was used to study the behaviour of small population sizes of mutant virus. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulations suggest that from the perspective of viral diversity, therapy should be started at the viral set-point. Starting treatment earlier involves a risk of the selective outgrowth of drug-resistant mutants, which are transiently present at the viral peak during primary infection.},

abstract = {Recently, potent combination antiviral therapies consisting of reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) drugs and protease inhibitor (PI) drugs, have been developed which can rapidly suppress HIV below the limit of detection. Two phases of plasma viral decay after initiation of treatment have been observed in clinical studies. Some researchers have suggested that the viral decay rates may reflect the potency (efficacy) of antiviral therapies. In this paper we model the effect of RTI drugs and PI drugs as inhibition rates of cell infection and infectious virus production, respectively, based on the biological mechanisms of these two different types of drugs. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we show that the two viral decay rates are monotone functions of the treatment effects of these antiviral therapies. We derive approximation formulas for the relationships between viral decay rates and treatment effects. Computer simulations show that the approximation formulas approximate the true values very well. These formulas may be used to study what factors really affect the viral decay rates. The results in this paper provide a theoretical justification for using both viral decay rates for evaluation of the treatment efficacy of antiviral therapies.},
